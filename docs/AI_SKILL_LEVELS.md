# 🎓 AI Skill Levels & Training

> **Adapting AI-assisted development to different skill levels — from learning accelerator for juniors to fleet manager for seniors.**

**Audience:** Team leads, developers at all levels | **Prerequisites:** [AI Development Guide][ai-guide]

## The Challenge

AI code generation creates a **cognitive crisis**: developers can produce working code without understanding it. This leads to the **Illusion of Competence** — the gap between _producing_ code and _comprehending_ it widens as AI handles more of the implementation work.

### The Neuroscience: Retrieval Practice vs Passive Review

From a cognitive science perspective, deep retention is forged through **Retrieval Practice** — the active effort of pulling information from memory and reconstructing solutions. By contrast, AI-assisted coding often results in **Passive Review**, a low-cognitive-load activity where developers read and approve solutions they didn't produce. Passive review creates "fragile memories" — the developer recognizes a solution when they see it, but cannot reproduce or adapt it independently.

This is why our training agents enforce **desirable difficulty**: `@socratic-mentor` deliberately withholds direct answers, forcing developers to retrieve knowledge actively rather than passively consuming AI output.

### The Risks

| Risk                          | Description                                                    | Impact                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vibe Coding**               | Accepting AI output without review or understanding            | Bugs compound, technical debt grows silently        |
| **Rubber-Stamping**           | Approving AI suggestions without critical evaluation           | Security vulnerabilities, convention violations     |
| **Skill Atrophy**             | Over-reliance on AI erodes fundamental engineering skills      | Inability to debug, architect, or reason about code |
| **God Service Trap**          | Letting AI create monolithic solutions instead of modular ones | Unmaintainable architecture, tight coupling         |
| **Hallucinated Dependencies** | AI invents APIs, packages, or patterns that don't exist        | Runtime failures, wasted debugging time             |

### Skill Decay vs. Skill Formation

Skill Atrophy is real — but the research picture is more nuanced than a simple decline narrative. A 2026 study found that AI tools act as a **skill accelerator** in some contexts and a **skill inhibitor** in others:

| Context | AI Effect | Mechanism |
| ------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Learning a new language/framework** | Accelerator ✅ | AI scaffolds unfamiliar syntax, letting the developer focus on concepts rather than lookup overhead |
| **Exploring an unfamiliar codebase** | Accelerator ✅ | AI summarizes patterns and traces dependencies faster than manual reading |
| **Core competency maintenance** | Inhibitor ⚠️ | Repeatedly delegating familiar tasks prevents the retrieval practice needed to maintain deep fluency |
| **Debugging complex logic** | Inhibitor ⚠️ | Accepting AI diagnoses without working through the failure path erodes diagnostic reasoning |

**Practical guidance:**
- Use AI liberally for **exploration** — new domains, unfamiliar technologies, first-time patterns
- Reserve **manual practice** for your core competencies — the skills your role depends on daily
- When `@socratic-mentor` asks you to reason before it answers, that deliberate friction is the mitigation for the Inhibitor cases above

> The existing `@socratic-mentor` agent already operationalizes this: it forces retrieval practice (predicting before seeing the answer) precisely in the contexts where AI would otherwise cause skill decay. Use it for your core domain, not just for onboarding.

The solution is not *less* AI — it's **structured AI usage** that matches the developer's skill level.

## The Seniority Competency Matrix

Different skill levels need different relationships with AI tools. This matrix maps each level to their ideal agent workflow.

### Traditional vs AI-Augmented Engineering

| Dimension | Traditional View | AI-Augmented View | Accountability Horizon |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Technical Execution** | Writing clean code manually | Verifying AI output; defining specs and plans | Hours to Days |
| **Knowledge Base** | Syntax & API memorization | System architecture; AI failure modes | Weeks to Months |
| **Debugging** | Manual step-by-step tracing | Analyzing agent logs; hypothesis-first testing | Months to Years |
| **Mentorship** | Pair programming with humans | Curating AI knowledge; teaching "AI Skepticism" | Infinite (Legacy) |

### Junior: Learning Accelerator

| Aspect             | Approach                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**           | Build foundational understanding through productive friction            |
| **AI Role**        | Tutor and explainer, not code generator                                 |
| **Primary Agents** | `@Onboarding` → `@socratic-mentor` → `@Specify`                         |
| **Key Practice**   | Prediction-first: always hypothesize before asking AI                   |
| **Risk**           | Accepting code without understanding → address with comprehension gates |

**Recommended workflow:**

1. Start with `@Onboarding` to understand project structure and conventions
2. Use `@socratic-mentor` to build mental models of patterns and concepts
3. Use `@Specify` to learn structured planning (input: what you learned)
4. Review `@Implement` output carefully — explain each change to yourself
5. Write tests with `@Test Unit` — understand what each assertion validates

### Mid-Level: Operator

| Aspect             | Approach                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**           | Increase velocity while maintaining quality                   |
| **AI Role**        | Productivity multiplier with human oversight                  |
| **Primary Agents** | `@Specify` → `@Implement` → `@Test Unit` / `@Test E2E`        |
| **Key Practice**   | Spec-before-code: always plan before implementing             |
| **Risk**           | Skipping review under time pressure → address with checklists |

**Recommended workflow:**

1. Use `@Specify` for planning — review the generated plan critically
2. Use `@Implement` for execution — verify each step against the plan
3. Use `@Test Unit` / `@Test E2E` for coverage — understand the test strategy
4. Return to `@socratic-mentor` when encountering unfamiliar patterns

### Senior: Orchestrator / Fleet Manager

| Aspect             | Approach                                                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**           | Maximize team output through strategic AI orchestration                     |
| **AI Role**        | Autonomous executor within well-defined boundaries                          |
| **Primary Agents** | All agents, including background and cloud agents                           |
| **Key Practice**   | Architecture-first: ensure AI works within sound design                     |
| **Risk**           | Over-delegation without architectural oversight → address with review gates |

**Recommended workflow:**

1. Design architecture and conventions first (these constrain AI output)
2. Use `@Specify` for complex features — delegate simpler plans to mid-levels
3. Review `@Implement` output for architectural concerns (not syntax)
4. Use `@socratic-mentor` to mentor juniors through code review discussions
5. Focus on instruction and skill file quality — these are your leverage points

### Claude Code Equivalents by Skill Level

| Developer Level | Recommended Starting Point | Claude Code Workflow |
|---|---|---|
| Junior | `/onboard` → `/mentor` → guided `/specify` | Use Plan mode; review every step; pair with `/verify` |
| Mid-Level | `/specify` → `/implement` → `/test-unit` | Full slash command workflow; use `/code-review` before merge |
| Senior | Full slash command set + CronCreate routines | Parallel subagents with worktree isolation; schedule automated routines |

### Key Differences: Training vs Production Agents

| Aspect              | Training Agents                           | Production Agents                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | Build understanding                       | Build software                                              |
| **Tools**           | Read-only (no `edit`, no `execute`)       | Role-dependent: read-only or edit/execute based on agent    |
| **Output**          | Explanations, questions, guidance         | Code, tests, plans, validations, reviews                    |
| **Code generation** | Never                                     | Role-dependent: core for builder agents; unused by validators |
| **When to use**     | Learning, onboarding, concept exploration | Planning, implementing, testing, validating, reviewing      |

## Agent Reference

### @Onboarding

**Role:** Project orientation guide for newcomers.

**When to use:**

- First day on the project
- Exploring an unfamiliar part of the codebase
- Understanding project conventions and tooling

**Example:**

```
@onboarding I'm new to this project. Show me around.
@onboarding How does the CSS variable system work here?
@onboarding I want to start contributing — what should I work on?
```

### @socratic-mentor

**Role:** Pedagogical tutor using Socratic questioning.

**When to use:**

- Learning a new concept or pattern
- Debugging with the goal of understanding (not just fixing)
- Preparing to work with unfamiliar technology
- Code review discussions with juniors

**Example:**

```
@socratic-mentor How do Pinia stores work in this project?
@socratic-mentor My API route returns 500 — help me understand why.
@socratic-mentor Why do we use field whitelisting in route handlers?
```

## Human-AI Pair Programming Modes

When working with `@Implement`, developers operate in one of two modes:

| Mode | Human Role | AI Role | Best For |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Mode A: AI Navigator** | Types the code | Critiques logic, suggests architecture, reviews without providing syntax | Learning, building deep understanding |
| **Mode B: AI Driver** | Steers via prompts and reviews | Generates code from specs and plans | Velocity on well-specified tasks |

**Guidance by seniority:**
- **Juniors** should primarily use **Mode A** — type code themselves while AI suggests improvements. This builds muscle memory and retrieval practice.
- **Mid-levels** alternate between modes based on task familiarity.
- **Seniors** primarily use **Mode B** for implementation, reserving their energy for architectural review and specification quality.

All modes follow the **Plan-Act-Verify** loop: the AI provides a plan, the human approves, the AI acts, and the human verifies.

## Atomic PRs and AI-Generated Code Reviews

When working with AI-generated code, enforce these review practices:

- **Atomic PRs:** Keep pull requests small and focused on a single concern. AI can generate large amounts of code quickly — resist the temptation to bundle everything into one PR.
- **Natural Language Summary:** Every PR with AI-generated code should include a summary the author can explain and defend orally. If you can't explain what changed and why, the PR isn't ready.
- **Hallucination Check:** Before merging, verify that all imported packages exist, have sufficient downloads, and are actively maintained. See the [security-review skill](../.github/skills/security-review/SKILL.md) for the AI-ism detection checklist.

## Core Concepts

### Cognitive Forcing Functions (CFFs)

CFFs are deliberate friction points that prevent autopilot behavior:

| CFF                       | Description                                      | Implementation                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prediction-First Gate** | Must hypothesize before debugging                | `@socratic-mentor` requires hypothesis before analysis |
| **Comprehension Gate**    | Must demonstrate understanding before proceeding | `@socratic-mentor` validates before handoff            |
| **Spec-Before-Code**      | Must plan before implementing                    | `@Specify` creates plan before `@Implement` starts     |
| **Review Gate**           | Must review before merging                       | Handoffs require human approval                        |
| **Why Obligation**        | Must explain _why_, not just _what_              | `@socratic-mentor` contrasts alternatives              |

### Plan-Act-Verify Cycle

Every feature follows this cycle:

1. **Plan** (`@Specify`) — Define what to build, resolve questions
2. **Act** (`@Implement`) — Build according to plan
3. **Verify** (`@Test Unit` / `@Test E2E` / `@Specify` validate) — Confirm correctness

This cycle enforces discipline at every level — juniors learn the rhythm, seniors enforce it.

### Ghost Text Policy

AI-generated inline suggestions (ghost text) should be treated with the same scrutiny as any other code:

- **Read** the suggestion completely before accepting
- **Understand** what it does and why
- **Verify** it follows project conventions
- **Reject** if you can't explain it

**For juniors:** Teams may choose to **disable ghost text entirely** during onboarding to enforce original thought and prevent the "Tab-Complete Zombie" pattern. This is a team-level decision — the key principle is that juniors must produce their own reasoning before seeing AI suggestions.

### SDD Maturity Model (Specification-Driven Development)

| Level                   | Description                                         | Agent Usage                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Level 1: Ad-hoc**     | No specs, direct implementation                     | Only `@Implement`                     |
| **Level 2: Reactive**   | Specs written after implementation                  | `@Implement` then `@Specify` validate |
| **Level 3: Proactive**  | Specs written before implementation                 | `@Specify` → `@Implement`             |
| **Level 4: Integrated** | Specs drive all development, continuously validated | Full agent workflow with gates        |

## AI-Native Metrics

Track these metrics to measure the health of AI-assisted development:

| Metric                        | What It Measures                              | Target               | Warning Sign                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Acceptance Rate**           | % of AI suggestions accepted                  | 30-60%               | >80% (rubber-stamping) or <10% (not using AI) |
| **MTTV** (Mean Time to Value) | Time from spec to working feature             | Decreasing over time | Increasing despite AI usage                   |
| **Defect Capture Rate**       | % of bugs caught before merge                 | >90%                 | Dropping after AI adoption                    |
| **Interaction Churn**         | Revisions needed per AI interaction           | <3 per task          | Increasing (poor prompting or conventions)    |
| **Comprehension Score**       | Developer's ability to explain AI output      | Self-assessed 4-5/5  | <3 (illusion of competence)                   |
| **Seniority Paradox Delta**   | Gap between junior velocity and understanding | Small                | Large gap = vibe coding risk                  |

### How to Use These Metrics

- **Team retrospectives:** Review acceptance rate and defect capture rate monthly
- **1-on-1s:** Discuss comprehension scores and learning progress
- **Process improvement:** Track MTTV and interaction churn to identify bottleneck conventions or skills
- **Risk assessment:** Monitor seniority paradox delta for juniors
